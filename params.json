HoeToa’s mission is to assist paddlers to discover their new competitive edge by sharing insights, tips, tricks and training programmes from innovators, champions and leaders in the paddling community. HoeToa is developed by Kingi Gilbert in collaboration with other well-known paddlers and athletes. \r\n\r\n### How we work\r\nHoeToa aims to release something new each couple of weeks on our website (here) and also on our Facebook or Twitter pages - that stuff is free to absorb. We also have a group of people who want something a little more special so we send crafted plans and videos to them via our 'Up by HoeToa' email channel.    \r\n\r\n### Up by HoeToa\r\nUp is a resource of crafted training programmes, downloadable books, video series and interviews for you to learn from. Some content is free and some paid - all have the aim of helping you to discover some new skills and speed with your paddling. To stay in-tune with special offers on 'Up' you will need to follow us on email by subscribing to join our email list. Download a bonus free programme from 'Up' right now and you will be added to our 'Up' group (you can get out at anytime if you don't like it by unsubscribing).  \r\n\r\n### Vault\r\nWe've also compiled a list of handy resources to help you organise your paddling lifestyle and to provide inspiration. A yearly calendar with paddling races and events. A library of paddling videos from around the world.  You can submit your content to our page at anytime by contacting kingi@hoetoa.com .\r\n\r\n### Latest News\r\nOn our blog you can find the latest news from events submitted by our fans, event organisers and other paddlers.
